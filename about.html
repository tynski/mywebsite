                    It is not so easy to write about myself in few short sentences. I have so many to say. Nevertheless I will try to do my best. So without further words letâ€™s begin.

                    I am studying Computer Science. I like solving problems and constantly learning, so programming seems like perfect choice (even writing this site I am learning how to be front-end developer). However what led me to CS was Artificial Intelligence,  to be more precisely Machine Learning. I think Deep Learning will have big impact on our future, even today we can observe big bloom in this industry.

                    Besides coding I like drinking coffee, but not this typical. Specialty coffee is the best possible quality of beans. Why it is so important? Only this way one can dive into diverse sensational world of coffee with all smells and flavors. I like to be impressed by  cup of my favorite beverage. Another day, another coffee.
